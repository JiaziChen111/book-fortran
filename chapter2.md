# Second Chapter: Simple programming in FORTRAN

FORTRAN is a bit different from Matalab. It is a low level language. Concretely this means that the steps needed to run some code are distinct:
1. writing the code
2. compiling the code
3. executing the code

## 1. Writing the code

To write the code use Atom. Open a file and call it ```myprogram.f90```. That's your *main* file. It has the following structure.

```
program main
  the code here
end program
```

## 2. Compiling the code

## 3. Executing the code
