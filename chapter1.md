# Chapter 1: Installing FORTRAN

I recommend to use Linux. On unix machines, Fortran is already installed. If one does not have a unix system, there is a possibility to use the following trick.

## Unix on Windows using Oracle

Install Oracle Virtual Box. You don't need anything else. This will install unix on your computer. Then install dropbox, and only sync the code folder of your program (for example myproject/code).

## Unix on Mac

I don't like Mac

## FORTRAN on Unix

Fortran is already ready to use on unix machines. The compiler is gfortran.
