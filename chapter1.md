# Preliminary: Installing FORTRAN

I recommend using Unix systems. On Unix machines \(such as Linux\), FORTRAN is already installed. If one does not have a Unix system, one can use Oracle Virtual Box to create one.

## Unix on Windows using Oracle

Download and install Oracle Virtual Box from Oracle website. Create a new virtual machine with unix operating system.  This will install unix on your computer. Then install Dropbox on both your computer and the virtual system. On the virtual system, only sync the folder of your program's code \(for example myproject/code\).

## Unix on Mac

I don't like Mac

## FORTRAN on Unix

Fortran is already ready to use on unix machines. The compiler is _gfortran_ \(see below for explanations on compilers\).
