# FORTRAN for Economists

## Why this book?

This book aims to help researchers use FORTRAN on economic problems. There exists a lot of FORTRAN manuals out there. I have yet not found one manual or book that dedicated to the resolution of common problems in economics.

This book aims researchers who have never used FORTRAN and who have no background in computing sciences. It will includes minimal examples based on economic problems I have encountered.

## Why FORTRAN?

Fortran has advantages and drawbacks. The most obvious advantage is that it is fast. Much faster than high level languages such as Matlab. High level means that a lot of things are dealt with in the background by the software. That is convenient because the researcher does not have to take care of it. And that is the drawback of FORTRAN: as a low level language, you need to give much more indications to FORTRAN. This is cumbersome. But it is actually also an advantage. The chances that something happens wrongly without you noticing it are indeed much lower.
