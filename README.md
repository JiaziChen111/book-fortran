# FORTRAN for Economists

## Why this book?

This book aims to help researchers use FORTRAN on economic problems. There exists a lot of FORTRAN manuals out there. I have yet not found one manual or book that dedicated to the resolution of common problems in economics.

This book aims researchers who have never used FORTRAN and who have no background in computing sciences. It will includes minimal examples based on economic problems I have encountered.
