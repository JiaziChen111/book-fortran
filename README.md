# FORTRAN for Social Scientists & Economists

## Why this book?

The goal  of this small book is to help researchers or students in social sciences, without background in computing sciences and without any specific knowledge about low-level programming languages to use FORTRAN for their research. One can easily find FORTRAN manuals on the internet but few of them are dedicated to the resolution of usual problems in social sciences and economics.

## Why FORTRAN?

Like any programming language, FORTRAN has advantages and drawbacks. The most obvious advantage is that it is **fast**, much faster than high level languages such as Matlab\(R\). High level means that a lot of things are dealt with in the background by the software interpreting the language. This is convenient because the user/programmer does not have to take care of them. Of course, that also means that when using FORTRAN one needs to give much more indications in the code. This might be cumbersome but it is also actually an advantage. The chances that something happens wrongly without you noticing it are indeed much lower.
